Anyone who is pro-choice is pro-abortionâ€¦there is no difference. They don't like the label however but its the truth. I just got banned from a place because I refused to stop using the term pro-abort to describe someone who â€¦DOES NOT WANT LEGAL PROTECTION FOR THE LIVING HUMAN BEING IN THE WOMB. This is not a pro-life person. This is a person who even though they might not get an abortion themselvesâ€¦is willing to sit by quietly while others kill in the name of CHOICE.   THEY ARE PRO-ABORTS. I can just see someone at a Right to Life conventionâ€¦standing up and sayingâ€¦." I am pro-life but believe that women should have the choice to kill." They would be laughed out of the room.  There is no difference between someone who is pro-abortion and someone who is pro-choiceâ€¦they want the same thingâ€¦.legalized killing.   Cutting off a piece of skinâ€¦.compared to stopping a beating heart of a human in the wombâ€¦..you think is the same thing? Laughableâ€¦won't even comment.  You probably no doubt think that killing a bug is the same as killing a human beingâ€¦.hey they are both alive right?  Yes babies are costly. How much did your parents foot the bill for your maintenance? At least your mother allowed you lifeâ€¦and you are here debating and defending the rights of other mothersâ€¦to kill, to take away the rights of others. What is it that Ronald Reagan saidâ€¦it was so true.  â€œAbortion is advocated only by persons who have themselves been born.â€?  Questionâ€¦.I know you are pro-abortion. Do you believe the a woman has the right to kill throughout the entire nine months? Oh I can't wait to see just how many rights you give womenâ€¦.to own their bodies.   Why is abortion bad you ask?   You said and I quoteâ€¦."I think you'll have to look very hard to find someone who is actually pro abortion, I've definitely never met someone who openly admits to that. It's pro-choice."  What is wrong with owning the label? You tell me what is wrong with being called pro-abortion? Is there something wrong with abortion Ben?  If there isâ€¦then why do you support it? If there isn'tâ€¦why isn't the label ok?   LOL
